# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## After you create your GitHub repository, you need to update these files:

### 1. Replace "yourusername" with your actual GitHub username in these files:

**Files to update:**
- index.html (lines with meta tags and structured data)
- sitemap.xml (all URLs)
- robots.txt (sitemap URL)

**Find and replace:**
- `yourusername` → `your-actual-github-username`

### 2. Your website will be live at:
`https://your-actual-github-username.github.io/wet-irrigation-website`

### 3. Example:
If your GitHub username is "johnsmith", your website URL will be:
`https://johnsmith.github.io/wet-irrigation-website`
